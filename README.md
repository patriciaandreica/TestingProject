# Senior Software Testing Project
Our goal with this project was to test the functionality of the Luma Apparel website. This website is a website made with the purpose of automation testing in mind and worked as a perfect website for this project to allow us to check a number of different functionalities that many retail websites contain.
We originally wanted to use the Target website; however, their website has protections put in place that block automation testing and didn’t allow us to test various functionality such as logging in to an account, adding items to a cart, or viewing and leaving a review for an item.

# Our Classes
###Logging into an account:###
An important part of any retail website is having an account that users can log into and retain various details personal to them. To test this functionality, we wrote our test to navigate to the website’s homepage, click on the ‘Sign In’ button, enter our email and password associated with our testing account, and then navigate to the profile page to ensure the account has successfully logged in. Our test case is considered “Passed” if the profile page is shown with our account information visible.
